## Summary
The Mind after Midnight is a neuroscience-driven hypothesis about how sleep and circadian rhythms drive dysregulated human behaviors. Briefly:
- Sleep restores the normal operations of our brains. When we don't sleep, our brains do not function well.
- Sleep occurs as part of our circadian rhythm, a roughly 24-hour rhythm that synchronizes our body to the day/night cycle. Normally, our circadian rhythm promotes brain activity during the day and diminishes it at night.
