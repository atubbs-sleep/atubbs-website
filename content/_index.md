## About Me
I am an [MD/PhD candidate](https://mdphd.medicine.arizona.edu/student/andrew-s-tubbs-phd) at the University of Arizona College of Medicine - Tucson. My research explores how sleep and circadian rhythms modify mental illness and increase risk for suicide, with a primary focus on the [Mind after Midnight Hypothesis](https://sleepeducation.org/mind-after-midnight/). You can read more about the research supporting this hypothesis [here](/the-mind-after-midnight/).

My clinical interest is in first-episode psychosis. I trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) under [Dr. Michael Perlis](michaelperlis.com) and [Dr. Michael Grandner](michaelgrandner.com), and treated patients (under supervision) for two and a half years at the Early Psychosis Intervention Center [(EPICenter)](https://psychiatry.arizona.edu/patient-care/epicenter). I am currently completing my MD training and will apply to Psychiatry residency in the 2023-2024 cycle. 

I strongly believe in open science and the free flow of information. I conduct all of my own analyses in R, and my main purpose for this site is to share my analyses (including code) to make my science both transparent and accessible.
